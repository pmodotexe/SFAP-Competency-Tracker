        critical: 'Filing rooms operate continuously across shifts, and saws are only one component in a multi-step cutting system. If communication breaks down, saws may be installed incorrectly, worn tools may be reused, or safety procedures may be skipped. Miscommunication leads to downtime, unsafe conditions, lumber defects, and avoidable delays in production. Team-based awareness, accurate documentation, and proactive communication are core to the professional standards of a certified filer.'

        critical: 'Saw filing cannot be learned by standing and watching. Many of the most important skills‚Äîtensioning, leveling, grinding geometry, safe handling‚Äîrequire hundreds of repetitions to master. Apprentices who do not ask questions or seek out new tasks tend to fall behind or develop unsafe habits.
