If communication breaks down, saws may be installed incorrectly, worn tools may be reused, or safety procedures may be skipped. Miscommunication leads to downtime, unsafe conditions, lumber defects, and avoidable delays in production. Team-based awareness, accurate documentation, and proactive communication are core to the professional standards of a certified filer.'

You must catch variations as small as 0.002" and respond with the correct technique and tool.\nüìè Flatness tolerances under 0.002" are used when inspecting for saw dish.
