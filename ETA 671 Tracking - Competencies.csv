‚Ä¢        Filing Room Role in Shift Continuity | Saw Filer 1, 1-2-4","A saw filer is part of a larger production team that includes supervisors, millwrights, operators, electricians, and fellow filers across different shifts. Being an effective team member means maintaining clear communication, supporting smooth shift transitions, working collaboratively, and upholding shared shop responsibilities. It also includes fulfilling your duties to your sponsor and actively participating in your apprenticeship obligations.","‚Ä¢        You coordinate with the incoming and outgoing filer about the current condition of saws, changes in strain or alignment, upcoming saw changes, and any issues observed during operation.
‚Ä¢        You record all issues or unusual conditions (e.g., vibration, gullet cracks, premature dulling, etc.) in shift logs or communication books, if in use.
‚Ä¢        You follow site-specific communication protocols such as tagging saws, labeling saws as out-of-service, or notifying supervisors when a saw or guide is awaiting repair or setup.
‚Ä¢        You assist other trades, especially millwrights, when removing, installing, or aligning saws‚Äîproviding details like direction of lead, prior setup details, or vibration concerns.
‚Ä¢        You fulfill your obligations to your sponsor by checking in regularly, reviewing progress, and ensuring your hours and logbook entries are up to date.
‚Ä¢        You are present during shift handovers, and you ensure continuity by briefing the next filer on incomplete work, saw setup status, or known troubleshooting.
","Filing rooms operate continuously across shifts, and saws are only one component in a multi-step cutting system. If communication breaks down, saws may be installed incorrectly, worn tools may be reused, or safety procedures may be skipped. Miscommunication leads to downtime, unsafe conditions, lumber defects, and avoidable delays in production. Team-based awareness, accurate documentation, and proactive communication are core to the professional standards of a certified filer."

Saw Filer 1, Section 13-1-1
","Precision is the cornerstone of all filing work. A journeyperson saw filer is expected to maintain microscopic accuracy during measurement, inspection, welding, grinding, and alignment procedures. This competency also requires sustained mental focus, even during repetitive or late-shift tasks. Attention to detail is not optional‚Äîit is a safety requirement. You must catch variations as small as 0.002"" and respond with the correct technique and tool.
üìè Flatness tolerances under 0.002"" are used when inspecting for saw dish. Even a dish of 0.002"" must be corrected before tensioning.
üìö Saw Filer 1, Section 13-1-1","‚Ä¢        When leveling a saw, you detect and correct a 0.002"" dish using a certified straightedge and correct hammering technique.
‚Ä¢        During tensioning, you observe the symmetry and integrity of the tension ring using proper back gauge placement and drop test verification, ensuring uniformity before any saw is cleared for service.
‚Ä¢        When using a micrometer or dial indicator, you:
o        Double-check readings for consistency
o        Clean both the saw surface and the measuring tool
o        Confirm tool calibration or report immediately if suspect
‚Ä¢        During blade inspections, you maintain full focus‚Äîeven when inspecting the third or fourth band of a shift‚Äîto ensure:
o        No gullet cracks, heat tint, or metal fatigue is missed
o        The saw body shows no signs of warping, twist, or abnormal wear
‚Ä¢        When regrinding a tooth, you:
o        Compare the result directly to a known-good profile
o        Use templates and cam settings to confirm accuracy rather than assuming angles are correct
","The filing trade deals in thousandths of an inch. A misaligned saw, under-tensioned plate, or grind angle off by even 1¬∞ can cause:
‚Ä¢	Blade wobble, snaking, or cracking
‚Ä¢	Excess heat and gullet fatigue
‚Ä¢	Misaligned cuts or lumber defects
‚Ä¢	Damage to bearings, guides, or collars
‚Ä¢	Personal injury from ejected parts or unexpected failure
Your vigilance prevents cascading errors that can cause downtime, reduce tool life, and compromise safety. A saw that ‚Äúlooks fine‚Äù may still fail at 10,000 FPM. You are the final line of defense."

Apprenticeship in the saw trades is not passive‚Äîit requires full engagement in both hands-on and technical learning. You are expected to take ownership of your development by staying involved in every aspect of the training process. This means participating actively in shop tasks, seeking clarification when needed, and tracking your skill progression using the ETA 671 Work Process Schedule (Saw Filer Competency Log).
Your mentor plays a critical role in shaping your training‚Äîbut it is your responsibility to follow through, ask questions, and pursue improvement. Filing is learned by doing, and every task you complete should move you closer to becoming a safe, skilled tradesperson.","‚Ä¢	You bring your ETA 671 Work Process Schedule (Saw Filer Competency Log) to evaluations and:
o	Ensure entries are up to date with clear descriptions of completed tasks
o	Obtain proper sign-off from your mentor based on direct observation
o	Use the log to guide what skills you still need exposure to
‚Ä¢	You engage your mentor with relevant, job-specific questions, such as:
o	‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best way to check for tight zones in this tension ring?‚Äù
o	‚ÄúShould I swage before or after confirming kerf width with the gauge?‚Äù
o	‚ÄúIs this crown profile correct for the feed rate we‚Äôre running?‚Äù
‚Ä¢	You request to repeat high-skill procedures or shadow others performing them, including:
o	Crack welding and annealing

o	Coordinating your schedule with your mentor and supervisor
o	Bringing current shop experiences and questions into the classroom for discussion
‚Ä¢	You actively track your hours and performance, using your log to:
o	Identify weak areas or incomplete competencies
o	Measure progress toward certification goals
o	Organize questions and tasks for review with your mentor","Saw filing cannot be learned by standing and watching. Many of the most important skills‚Äîtensioning, leveling, grinding geometry, safe handling‚Äîrequire hundreds of repetitions to master. Apprentices who do not ask questions or seek out new tasks tend to fall behind or develop unsafe habits. A passive approach delays your certification and places the burden on your mentor to chase your development.
In contrast, a filer who participates actively builds:
‚Ä¢	Technical confidence
‚Ä¢	Reliable habits under pressure
‚Ä¢	A complete training record
‚Ä¢	Trust and credibility with their team

‚Ä¢	Communication with Other Trades and Team Roles
Saw Filer 1, Sections 1-2-5 to 1-2-6","A skilled filer is not only a technician but a problem solver and contributor to shop improvement. Sharing ideas means voicing observations that can prevent damage, reduce waste, improve workflow, or enhance safety. Whether it's a small adjustment to a tagging system or a technical insight about guide pressure, your input helps optimize the operation. This is especially important during shift changes, saw troubleshooting, or when testing new setups.
As a professional, your role includes offering constructive, evidence-based suggestions, regardless of your level of experience. Apprentices who speak up respectfully build trust and show a genuine commitment to the trade.","‚Ä¢        You identify that a grinding wheel is wearing unevenly, and recommend replacement before it causes improper tooth geometry, excessive heat, or vibration.
‚Ä¢        You notice that the saw storage rack has bent hooks, and explain how it could warp saws, recommending realignment or replacement.
‚Ä¢        You suggest introducing a visual tagging system using magnets, flags, or color codes to clearly mark:
o        Saws that are tensioned and ready
o        Saws awaiting weld inspection
o        Saws tagged out due to damage or imbalance
‚Ä¢        You observe that increasing table travel speed during knife grinding reduced heat tint, and demonstrate the result to your mentor or crew.
‚Ä¢        You report a recurring issue on the edger, pointing out that guide bolts may be backing off or misaligned‚Äîprompting an adjustment that prevents further defects.
‚Ä¢        During a team install, you suggest reviewing back gauge measurements due to unexpected tracking on the previous shift‚Äîleading to correction of a strain offset.
These are just a few examples.","‚ùó Why this is critical:
Filers are closest to the tools, the saws, and the real-time issues that impact performance and safety. No one sees everything, and a single overlooked issue‚Äîlike a dull grinder, untagged saw, or guide slip‚Äîcan lead to:
‚Ä¢	Unsafe equipment being reinstalled
